# Flux

> **flux-niri** is a fork of [bjarneo/flux](https://github.com/bjarneo/flux) for Arch Linux with the [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) compositor and the iNiR Quickshell shell.
> The rest of this README is the upstream README.

## What the fork changes

| Area | On niri |
| --- | --- |
| Do Not Disturb sync | Syncs with iNiR's `notifications.silent`. It reads `~/.config/inir/config.json` and toggles the setting over `qs ipc`. |
| Remote desktop | Streams the niri output that has focus, and wakes the displays with `niri msg action power-on-monitors`. |
| Phone shortcuts panel | Lists the workspaces of the focused output, and runs the fixed actions (close, fullscreen, float, workspaces, focus, move) through `niri msg action`. niri cannot list its key bindings over IPC, so the binding list stays empty. niri has no scratchpad. |
| Shortcut | [`dist/niri.kdl`](dist/niri.kdl) binds `Mod+Alt+F` to `flux-cli open`. |
| Tray icon | The Qt window adds a Flux icon to the system tray. A click opens the window, and the menu has **Open Flux**, **Start Flux**, and **Quit Flux**, which turns `fluxd` off. Closing the window keeps Flux in the tray. `flux-gui --hidden` starts in the tray, and [`dist/niri.kdl`](dist/niri.kdl) runs it at login. |
| Package | Builds `flux-niri`, which replaces `omarchy-flux`. `flux-cli update` prints the commands that rebuild the fork, so it never installs the upstream package over the fork. |

Hyprland and Omarchy keep working as upstream.
The omarchy-shell plugin stays unused on niri. `flux-cli open` opens the Qt window.

## Install the fork

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed base-devel git go cmake ninja gpu-screen-recorder
git clone https://github.com/kraddess/flux-niri.git
cd flux-niri/dist/arch
makepkg -si
sudo systemctl enable --now avahi-daemon
flux-cli setup
flux-cli doctor
```

Paste [`dist/niri.kdl`](dist/niri.kdl) into your niri config, for example `~/.config/niri/config.d/90-user-extra.kdl`.
A file takes 1 `binds` node, so move the bind into a `binds` node that the file already has.
Then pair a phone as in [Connect your phone](#connect-your-phone).

## Update the fork

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/bjarneo/flux.git   # once
git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/main
cd dist/arch && makepkg -si
```

## License

Upstream Flux has no license yet, so its code keeps all rights with its author.
The `LICENSE` file of this fork covers only the changes of this fork.

---

Connect your Omarchy desktop to an Android phone, an iPhone, or a Mac over your local network, or through Tailscale when you are away.
Share files, clipboard text, and clipboard images, read phone notifications, control media, and use your phone as a camera or microphone.

Flux includes a CLI, a background daemon, a native Qt window, an Omarchy shell plugin, a native Android app, a native iOS app, and a native macOS app.
The desktop opens the network connections, so the default Omarchy firewall needs no new inbound rule.

Flux for Android requires Android 10 or later.
Flux for Android is the supported phone app.

Flux for iOS requires iOS 17 or later.
It connects an iPhone in the place of the Android phone and offers the features that iOS allows.
Install it with Xcode. See [Flux for iOS](docs/ios.md) for the feature list and the limits of iOS.

Flux for macOS requires macOS 14 or later.
It connects a Mac in the place of a phone and offers the features that macOS allows.
See [Flux for macOS](docs/macos.md) for the feature list.

## Clone and install

On Omarchy or Arch Linux, install the build tools:

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu --needed base-devel git go cmake ninja
```

Clone this repository and setup:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bjarneo/flux.git
cd flux/dist/arch
makepkg -si
flux-cli setup
flux-cli doctor
flux-cli open
```

The package includes the Qt app, CLI, daemon, shell plugin, approval helper, desktop entry, icons, and system files.
Run `flux-cli setup` as your desktop user after installation.
The short name `flux` also works when no other program, such as `fluxcd`, uses that name.

The [install guide](docs/install.md) covers dependencies, source builds, user-only installation, updates, and removal.
Flux checks for a new release once a day. To install it, run `flux-cli update`.

## Connect your phone

1. [Install Flux for Android](docs/android.md).
2. Connect the phone and desktop to the same local network.
3. Open the desktop window with `flux-cli open`.
4. Select **+ Pair new device**.
5. Compare the 8-character verification key on both screens.
6. Accept the matching request on the phone.

You can also start the pair request from a terminal:

```sh
flux-cli pair "Pixel 8"
```

To connect an iPhone, install the app with Xcode and follow [Pair an iPhone](docs/ios.md#pair-an-iphone).
To connect a Mac, build the app and follow [Pair a Mac](docs/macos.md#pair-a-mac).

## Use it from your terminal

```sh
flux-cli status
flux-cli send "$HOME/Downloads/report.txt"
flux-cli clip
flux-cli url https://omarchy.org
flux-cli ring
flux-cli notify --run -- make test
```

To select one of multiple connected phones, add `--device`:

```sh
flux-cli --device "Pixel 8" send "$HOME/Downloads/report.txt"
```

See the [CLI reference](docs/cli.md) for commands and script examples.

## Build and release

```sh
make build test vet
make android
```

GitHub Actions builds the complete Arch package and Android APKs for pull requests and the `main` branch.
Stable version tags produce a signed APK, an Arch package, an AUR recipe, an ad hoc signed macOS app, an unsigned iOS app for sideload tools, and checksums.
The optional AUR job publishes the tested recipe after the GitHub release succeeds.

On a Mac with Xcode and XcodeGen, test, build, and install the macOS app:

```sh
make test-macos macos
make install-macos
```

To build the iOS app and run its tests in a simulator:

```sh
make ios test-ios
```

GitHub Actions also tests FluxKit, builds the macOS and iOS apps, and runs the iOS tests in a simulator.

See [development](docs/development.md) for local checks and [releases](docs/releasing.md) for keys, secrets, tags, and artifacts.
